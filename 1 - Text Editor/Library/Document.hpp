  ** One of the goals of this assignment is to easily change the underlying container type. Homework 1 demonstrated how a type alias
  ** can be used to localize the changes necessary when changing the underlying container. We haven't formally treated template
  ** classes in detail yet, I did introduce them in the Fundamentals course. I want to re-introduce the topic again here. Templates
  ** are easy to read, but can be intimidating to write. You are welcome to implement this assignment using the pre-processor
  ** technique presented in homework 1. But by providing you this class template header file, my hope is that you'll embrace this
  ** class template technique in your solution. In the long run, a template solution is a better way to go and you'll see more of
  ** them as the course moves forward. Instead of a constant type definition, think of the template parameters as a variable type
  ** definition to be resolved at compile time. Functionally, All we're doing here is allowing the client of this class to choose
  ** the underlying container. All we have to do is to design the class to be container neutral.

// Inline functions and template definitions must be part of the header file. To help keep the size of the header file manageable
// and to keep implementation definitions separated from interface declaration, the header file has been divided into two.
// Library/Document.hxx is not intended to be included by clients and serves only to allow Document and related declarations to be
// separated from implementation whist making inline function and template definitions visible to all translation units. This
// technique is primary used as a teaching tool. I don't see this in real-world applications often, but it's out there. It allows me
// to distribute the declarations without the definitions. Normally, the contents of "Library/Document.hxx" would be physically
// entered below instead of telling the pre-processor to include the contents.
#include "Library/Document.hxx"       // inline and function Document definitions
